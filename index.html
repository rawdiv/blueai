        <h1>Blue Mind – The Future of Private AI</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Think Loud. Stay Private.<br>Blue Mind is an intelligent GPT assistant that respects your privacy by design. It never stores your data, never uses your chats for training, and always acts on your behalf — not behind your back. Built for those who want true AI power without surveillance, Blue Mind is fast, capable, and completely memory-free.</p>

        <h2>What Makes Blue Mind Different</h2>
        <p class="section-desc">Blue Mind is built to <strong>act</strong>, not just chat. From advanced automation to real-world action, it's designed as your personal AI agent — available across platforms and focused on results.</p>
        <div class="features-grid">
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Agentic AI That Acts</h3>
            <p>Ask it to find people interested in a product and send them emails. Request outreach tasks, data searches, or campaign actions — and it executes. It’s an AI that doesn’t just answer, it <em>works</em>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>YouTube Video Understanding</h3>
            <p>Paste a video link and ask questions like “List all the places shown,” “Summarize the storyline,” or “Extract key quotes.” It analyzes and delivers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Cross-Platform Access</h3>
            <p>Use Blue Mind across web, WhatsApp, or even phone calls. You can talk to it via chat, voice note, or speak live — it listens and responds like a human.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Privacy-First by Design</h3>
            <p>It does not track, store, or remember any messages. Everything disappears after the session. Blue Mind is built on <strong>public knowledge only</strong>, never on private data.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Custom Tone & Persona</h3>
            <p>Talk to your AI your way — let it be your chill buddy, sharp consultant, or professional assistant. It adapts its tone to suit your needs and style.</p>

        <h2>A Message from Our Founder</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>At Blue Mind, we didn’t want to build another AI that just talks — we wanted to build one you could trust. Most AI systems today log your messages, store your conversations, and train on your inputs. Ours doesn’t.</em></p>
          <p><em>We believe privacy is not a setting — it’s a principle. Blue Mind was built for people who want power without compromise. For founders, creators, operators, and everyday users who want AI to act — and forget.</em></p>
